Odd Divisors
You are given an interval of integers [A,B].
For each number in this interval compute its greatest odd divisor. Output the sum of these divisors.

Standard input
The first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases that will follow.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integer values A and B.

Standard output
The output should contain the answer for each test case on a different line.
Each answer consists of a single integer value.
